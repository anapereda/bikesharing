# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

I created a Tableu Story to showcase the possibility of opening a citibike business in Des Moise, IO based on the experience of New York city

## StoryPoint 1: 

You can see the difference in population between the two cities. New York city holds more than 10 times the amount of people. You can also see the location of the two cities on a map and the distribution of ages. As you may notice the distribution of age is very similar; this is very relevant because there is a majority of people within the age group who are the most likely to use the bikes. 

## StoryPoint 2: 

Using the NYC citibike from August 2019, I plotted the birthdate of riders vs number of counts. The bult amount of riders were born after 1960 and younger. The similar age distribution support the idea of having a similar business. 

## StoryPoint 3: 

The main users are subscribers; NYC has big influx of tourist. Since Des Moise is a much smaller city and does not bring thaat many tourists a different distribution could present a problem to the suggested business model.

In conclusion, data similar population distribution and NYC citibike data suggests that Des Moise is a good candidate to have a citibike business. The data needs to be further explored to determine strategic points to place bikes and the ideal number of bikes available.
